        """A method to convert a set of guest restraints defined by their 'schemas'
        into corresponding ``DAT_restraint``objects.

        Each 'schema' should be a dictionary with:
            * an ``atoms`` entry with a value of the atom selection make which specifies
              which atoms the restraint will apply to

        and additionally a nested ``attach`` and ``pull`` dictionary with

            * a ``force_constant`` entry which specifies the force constant of the
              restraint.
            * a ``target`` entry which specifies the target value of the restraint.

        These 'schemas` map directly to the 'restraints -> guest -> restraint'
        dictionaries specified in the `taproom` guest YAML files.

        Parameters
        ----------
        coordinate_path
            The path to the coordinate file which the restraints will be applied to.
            This should contain either the host or the complex, the dummy atoms and
            and solvent.
        attach_lambdas
            The values 'lambda' being used during the attach phase of the APR
            calculation.
        n_pull_windows
            The total number of pull windows being used in the APR calculation.
        restraint_schemas
            The list of dictionaries which provide the settings to use for each
            wall restraint to add.
        use_amber_indices
            Whether to use amber based (i.e. starting from 1) restraint indices or
            OpenMM based (i.e. starting from 0) indices.

        Returns
        -------
            The constructed wall restraint objects.

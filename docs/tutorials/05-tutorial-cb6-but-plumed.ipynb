    "In this tutorial, we will perform APR calculations for the butane (BUT)--cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) host-guest system. This is a repeat of [tutorial 1](01-tutorial-cb6-but.ipynb) using `Plumed`-based restraints and the `Amber` MD engine. `Plumed` is a plugin for MD codes that can analyze trajectories and perform free-energy calculations on collective variables. It is a versatile plugin that can interface with a number of MD engines. Here, we will go through the process of converting APR restraints constructed with pAPRika to a `Plumed` file and run a short calculation with `Sander`."

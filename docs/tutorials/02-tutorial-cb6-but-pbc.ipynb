    "Unlike the previous tutorial, in this one, we will solvate the host-guest complex in water with additional Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. This tutorial builds off tutorial 1. I've marked new pieces of information with a blue circle, like so:\n",

    "🔵 Since we have a prepared host-guest-dummy setup from the first tutorial, I'm going to skip the initial `tleap` steps and go right into initializing the restraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "🔵 The default mode of *pAPRika* is to detect whether a simulation has completed successfully, and if so, skip that window. This helps when launching mulitple jobs on a cluster or queuing system that might kill jobs after a pre-determined time. That means that running this notebook with the same set of windows as the first tutorial will not re-run the simulations and the results won't change. The easiest thing to do is to rename or delete the existing `windows` directory, if you would like to compare the results between the two methods."

Next, we generally apply a distance restraint until the guest is ~18 Angstroms away from the host, in increments of 0.4 Angstroms. This distance should be at least twice the Lennard-Jones cutoff in the system. These values have worked well for us, but this is one aspect that should be carefully checked for new systems."

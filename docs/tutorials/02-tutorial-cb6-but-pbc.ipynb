    "In this example, we will setup and simulate butane (BUT) as a guest molecule for the host [cucurbit[6]uril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbituril) (CB6). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous tutorial, in this one, we will solvate the host-guest complex in water with additional Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. This tutorial builds off tutorial 1. I've marked new pieces of information with a blue circle, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”µ Since we have a prepared host-guest-dummy setup from the first tutorial, I'm going to skip the initial `tleap` steps and go right into initializing the restraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”µ The default mode of *pAPRika* is to detect whether a simulation has completed successfully, and if so, skip that window. This helps when launching mulitple jobs on a cluster or queuing system that might kill jobs after a pre-determined time. That means that running this notebook with the same set of windows as the first tutorial will not re-run the simulations and the results won't change. The easiest thing to do is to rename or delete the existing `windows` directory, if you would like to compare the results between the two methods."

Next, we generally apply a distance restraint until the guest is ~18 Angstroms away from the host, in increments of 0.4 Angstroms. This distance should be at least twice the Lennard-Jones cutoff in the system. These values have worked well for us, but this is one aspect that should be carefully checked for new systems."

The total simulation time per window, in nanoseconds, is (nstlim) Ã— (dt in fs / 1000) = (50000) Ã— (0.002 / 1000) = 0.1 ns. This is still very short and just for demonstration.

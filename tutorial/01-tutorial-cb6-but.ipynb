CBs are rigid, symmetric, cyclic host molecules with oxygen atoms around the portal edge of the cavity. We will run the simulation in implicit solvent, using the [Generalized-Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_solvation#Generalized_Born) model, for speed and simplicity, using AMBER.

This does not have to perfectly match the bound state by any means (we will later minimize and equilibrate), but this should be a reasonable illustration of the bound complex.

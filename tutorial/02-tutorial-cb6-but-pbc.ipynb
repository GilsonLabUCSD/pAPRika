    "![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) The default mode of pAPRika is to detect whether a simulation has completed successfully, and if so, skip that window. This helps when launching mulitple jobs on a cluster or queuing system that might kill jobs after a pre-determined time. That means that running this notebook with the same set of windows as the first tutorial will not re-run the simulations and the results won't change. The easiest thing to do is to rename or delete the existing `windows` directory, if you would like to compare the results between the two methods."

This distance should be at least twice the Lennard-Jones cutoff in the system. These values have worked well for us, but this is one aspect that should be carefully checked for new systems."

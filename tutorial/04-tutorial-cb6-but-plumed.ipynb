    "# pAPRika tutorial 4 - APR/Amber with Plumed restraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will perform APR calculations for butane (BUT)--cucurbit[6]uril (CB6). This is a repeat of [tutorial 1](01-tutorial-cb6-but.ipynb) using `Plumed`-based restraints and the `Amber` MD engine. `Plumed` is a plugin for MD codes that can analyze trajectories and perform free-energy calculations on collective variables. We will go through the process of converting APR restraints constructed with pAPRika to a `Plumed` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that you have `Plumed` installed. We will run the simulation in this tutorial with `sander` and from version 15 the code is already patched with `Plumed`. Amber 18 requires patching before it can run with `Plumed` but the latest version (version 20) does not require any patching. See the `Plumed` documentation for more details https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.6/user-doc/html/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”µ Since we have a prepared the host-guest-dummy setup from the first tutorial, we will skip the initial tleap steps and go right into initializing the restraints."

In this tutorial we will print the **host static** restraints and the **guest** restraints. The `Plumed` class includes a method to add restraints to dummy atoms (`add_dummy_atoms_to_file`) but we will not do that here. Instead we will use the built-in position restraints feature in Amber (see [Simulation](#simulate) section below).\n",

We follow the Amber (and CHARMM) convention where the force constant is already multiplied by a factor of 1/2 but `Plumed` requires the user to specify the force constant without this factor. If Amber force constants was used in generating the restraints (the case in this tutorial) we need to set the variable `uses_legacy_k` to `True` (this is on by default)."
